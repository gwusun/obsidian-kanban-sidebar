## Hide tags in card titles

By default, tags will display in a card's main text. This setting allows you to visually remove tags from this text. Tags still remain, but are not displayed. This setting is meant to be used in conjunction with the [Hide card display tags](Hide%20card%20display%20tags.md) setting.
