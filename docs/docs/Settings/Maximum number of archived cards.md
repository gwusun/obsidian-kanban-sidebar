## Maximum number of archived cards

By default, a Kanban board's [archive](../How%20do%20I/View%20a%20Kanban's%20archive.md) will grow infinitely. Setting the maximum number of archived cards will cap the archive at the specified number. 

For example, if `Maximum number of archived cards` is set to `100`, the archive will never contain more than 100 cards. When the archive reaches its maximum, old cards will be deleted as new cards are added.
