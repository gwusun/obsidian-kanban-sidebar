## Add date and time to archived cards

When active, a time stamp will be added to cards when they are archived. This will be added to the beginning of the card, and can be separated from the card's content using the [Archive date time separator](Archive%20date%20time%20separator.md) setting. The date format can be controlled with the [Archive date time format](Archive%20date%20time%20format.md) setting.
