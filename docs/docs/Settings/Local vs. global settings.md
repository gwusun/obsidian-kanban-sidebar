## Local vs. global settings

The settings for the Kanban plugin can be set globally, as well as on a per-board basis. Global settings can be found in `Settings > Kanban`.

Global settings can be overridden on a per-board basis by modifying the board's settings, which can be accessed through the [Board header buttons](Board%20header%20buttons.md) or the `More options menu`.
