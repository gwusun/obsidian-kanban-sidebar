## Frontmatter limitations & gotchas

There are some quirks to be aware of then adding metadata to a [linked note](../Settings/Linked%20page%20metadata.md). Links and image embeds must be wrapped in quotes, for example, to show up as [Linked page metadata](../Settings/Linked%20page%20metadata.md). In general, if you have trouble getting frontmatter fields to display in a card, try wrapping it in quotes.
