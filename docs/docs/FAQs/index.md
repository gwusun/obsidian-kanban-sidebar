## Frontmatter limitations & gotchas

There are some quirks to be aware of then adding metadata to a [linked note](../Settings/Linked%20page%20metadata.md). Links and image embeds must be wrapped in quotes, for example, to show up as [Linked page metadata](../Settings/Linked%20page%20metadata.md). In general, if you have trouble getting frontmatter fields to display in a card, try wrapping it in quotes.

See: [Add an image to a card](../How%20do%20I/Add%20an%20image%20to%20a%20card.md)
