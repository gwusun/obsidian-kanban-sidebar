## Set a WIP Limit for a Lane

To set a WIP (work in progress) limit for a lane, specify it in parentheses after the lane title
when creating or renaming it. For example, to set the limit cards amount in the existing "In Progress"
lane to 5, rename it to `In Progress (5)`.

This limit will be displayed next to the item counter of the lane:

Once the number of cards exceeds the limit, the counter text will become bold:

<img alt="Screen Shot WIP-Limit-exceeded.png" srcset="/obsidian-kanban/Assets/Screen%20Shot%20WIP-Limit-exceeded.png 2x">

To update the WIP limit, simply rename the lane specifying the new value.
