## Create notes from cards

Notes can be created from Kanban cards by right clicking on a card, or clicking on the three dots menu on the right side of a card, and selecting `New note from card`.

This will create a new note in the [Note folder](../Settings/Note%20folder.md) using the [Note template](../Settings/Note%20template.md) with the card's content as the title. The card will then link to the new note.
