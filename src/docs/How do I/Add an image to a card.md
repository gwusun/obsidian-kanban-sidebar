## Add an image to a card

Images can be added to cards in two ways.

### Embedding images

Images can be embedded into Kanban cards just like you would in any other obsidian note.

### Displaying images from metadata

To add an image to a card, first enable a [[Linked page metadata]] key/value, with the key set to the metadata field containing an image. Toggle `Field contains markdown`.

#### Adding image to frontmatter

If the [[Linked page metadata]] key you're pulling in is in the linked page's frontmatter, **image embeds must be wrapped in quotes, or contain other text before the embed**. This is a quirk of [YAML](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter). (See also: [[Frontmatter limitations & gotchas]])

#### Adding image to inline metadata

Images can also be added to inline metadata if the [Data View](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin is active. When adding an image via inline metadata, quotes are not required.
