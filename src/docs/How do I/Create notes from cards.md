## Create notes from cards

Notes can be created from Kanban cards by right clicking on a card, or clicking on the three dots menu on the right side of a card, and selecting `New note from card`.

This will create a new note in the [[Note folder]] using the [[Note template]] with the card's content as the title. The card will then link to the new note.
